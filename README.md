## Resources

1. [Canvas Course page](https://ufl.instructure.com/courses/330762/pages/hands-on-responsive-transformation?module_item_id=6205785)

    I followed along the Recreation site responsive design lecture so that I could approach the Keyboard site in a similar process. I didn't intend to make the exact same changes, but more to keep myself paced and organized. Although it definitely helped having an instructor walk me through it! I also referenced code from lecture like the `box-sizing: border-box;` CSS property, the lobotomized owl selector and the calc property.

2. [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/)

    I used EditorConfig to reference the list of properties and make sure I implemented them correctly.

3. [Git: Amend your last commit](https://nathanhoad.net/git-amend-your-last-commit)

    Because I make lots of mistakes.

4. [W3Schools - CSS Padding](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_padding.asp)

    I can never remember the order for writing margin and padding in shorthand, so this page helps spell it out for me.

5. [html5 Doctor - The Article Element](http://html5doctor.com/the-article-element/)

    This article contained helpful information about... articles. Basically I wanted to double check the rules of containing a section within an article or vice versa.


6. [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/src/css/main.css)

    I used the `.visuallyhidden` declaration defined in the boilerplate's CSS stylesheet to hide the HTML5 Outliner headings.

## Deductions
_I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus._

## Comments
I am loving responsive design!

I hope my commit messages are not too similar to the ones you made in lecture. Since I followed along, a good portion of the changes occurred at the same time but I tried to make sure they were not verbatim.
